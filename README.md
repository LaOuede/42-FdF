<h1 align=center>FdF</h1>

<p align=center>
 The <b>FDF</b> project is a 3D wireframe renderer developed to visualize terrain maps using C programming language and the MLX42 graphic library.
 The project involves reading map files, calculating the appropriate heights for each point, and rendering a wireframe representation of the terrain.

<h3 align="left">What I've learned</h3>

I've acquired a lot of basic knowledge on C programming :
- Data extraction
- Graphics Programming (MLX42)
- Algorithms (DDA and Bresenham)
- User Interface Design
- Testing and debugging

---

<h3 align="left">If I had to do it all over again</h3>

- I would improve the way I've implemented rotations.
- I would implement a double view.
- I would upgrade my linear gradient.
- I would allow window resizing.
